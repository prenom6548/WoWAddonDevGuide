## Architecture Overview

The WoW Claude Code integration uses a **coordinator/worker architecture** designed to conserve context while maintaining thoroughness:

```

```

**Benefits:**
- **Context Conservation**: Large documentation files are read in isolated agent context, not your main conversation
- **Thoroughness**: The agent has full access to all 19 documentation files
- **Efficiency**: Coordinator stays lightweight; only results return to main conversation
- **Sub-agent Support**: For very large research tasks, the agent can spawn additional subagents

---

## Installation

The command and agent files are located in `Claude AI Commands (optional)/` within this guide directory. See `README.md` in that directory for a quick-start summary.

### Step 1: Copy the Agent File

Copy `Claude AI Commands (optional)/WoWAddon-Expert.md` to your Claude agents directory:

```
~/.claude/agents/WoWAddon-Expert.md
```

On Windows, this is typically:
```
C:\Users\<YourUsername>\.claude\agents\WoWAddon-Expert.md
```

### Step 2: Copy the Command File

Copy `Claude AI Commands (optional)/wow.md` to your Claude commands directory:

```
~/.claude/commands/wow.md
```

On Windows, this is typically:
```
C:\Users\<YourUsername>\.claude\commands\wow.md
```

### Step 3: Update the Agent's Local Paths

Edit `WoWAddon-Expert.md` and update the **Local Paths** section at the very top of the file:

```
## Local Paths (UPDATE THESE FOR YOUR SYSTEM)

ADDONS_DIR:    D:\Games\World of Warcraft\_retail_\Interface\AddOns\
GUIDE_DIR:     D:\Games\World of Warcraft\_retail_\Interface\+++WoW Addon Development Guide (AI Generated)+++\
BLIZZARD_SRC:  D:\Games\World of Warcraft\_retail_\Interface\+wow-ui-source+ (12.0.0)\
```

Change these paths to match where you have:
- **ADDONS_DIR**: Your WoW AddOns directory
- **GUIDE_DIR**: This WoW Addon Development Guide directory
- **BLIZZARD_SRC**: Your Blizzard UI source directory (the `+wow-ui-source+` folder you downloaded/extracted alongside the game client)

### Step 4: Update the Coordinator's User Configuration

Edit `wow.md` and update the **User Configuration** table at the very top of the file:

```
| **AddOns Directory**    | D:\Games\World of Warcraft\_retail_\Interface\AddOns             |
| **Blizzard UI Source**  | D:\Games\World of Warcraft\_retail_\Interface\+wow-ui-source+ (12.0.0) |
```

The coordinator passes these paths to the subagent on each delegation, so both files need to know where your WoW installation lives.

### Step 5: Verify Installation

1. Close and reopen Claude Code (commands and agents are loaded at startup)
2. Type `/` and look for `wow` in the command list
3. If it appears, you're ready to go!

---

## Using the /wow Command

Once installed, simply invoke the command and describe what you need:

```
/wow I need an addon that tracks my cooldowns and shows alerts.
```

The coordinator will:
1. **Ask clarifying questions** if your request is ambiguous
2. **Delegate the heavy work** to the WoWAddon-Expert agent
3. **Summarize the results** and ask if you need anything else

---

## How It Works

### The Coordinator (`/wow`)

The coordinator is a lightweight prompt that:
- Understands user requests
- Asks clarifying questions when needed
- Delegates actual work to the WoWAddon-Expert agent
- Synthesizes and summarizes results

It does NOT read documentation files directly, keeping your main conversation context clean.

### The Worker Agent (WoWAddon-Expert)

The agent runs in an isolated context and:
- Reads documentation files (all 19 guides)
- Analyzes existing addons
- Creates and edits addon files
- Debugs issues
- Has full edit authority

**Large File Handling:** The agent knows which documentation files are large and can spawn additional subagents to read them if needed.

---

## Example Usage

### Example 1: Creating a New Addon

```
/wow

I need to create an addon that:
1. Tracks my gold across all characters
2. Shows a summary in a custom UI window
3. Adds a minimap icon to toggle the window
```

The coordinator will ask clarifying questions like:
- "Should it track gold per realm or account-wide?"
- "Do you want to use Ace3 or vanilla Blizzard UI?"
- "Should it include LibDataBroker support?"

Then it delegates to the agent to create the addon.

### Example 2: Debugging Existing Code

```
/wow

My addon's saved variables aren't loading. Here's my code:
[paste your code]

What's wrong?
```

The agent will analyze your code, reference the documentation, and identify the issue (likely accessing SavedVariables before ADDON_LOADED fires).

### Example 3: Learning a Specific Topic

```
/wow I want to learn how to use mixins and templates like Blizzard does. Show me examples.
```

The agent will read the relevant documentation and provide examples with explanations.

### Example 4: UI Development

```
/wow Help me create action buttons with cooldown spinners for my addon.
```

The agent will reference the UI Framework guide and create the code.

## Tips for Best Results

### Be Specific About Your Needs

**Good:**
```
/wow

I need an addon that monitors my target's health and displays it
in a custom status bar with configurable colors. I want to use
modern Blizzard UI patterns.
```

**Less Effective:**
```
/wow Help with UI.
```

### Mention Your Experience Level

```
/wow I'm familiar with Lua but new to WoW addon development. I need help
understanding how to register and handle events.
```

### Reference Existing Code When Debugging

```
/wow

Here's my addon code:
[paste code]

It's throwing an error when I try to access saved variables.
```

### Request Modern Patterns

```
/wow Show me the modern way to create action buttons. I want to use mixins
and templates like Blizzard does.
```

---

## Alternative: Direct Path Reference

If you don't want to set up the command/agent system, you can still reference the guide directly:

```
I need help with WoW addon development. Please read the documentation at:
D:\Path\To\WoW Addon Development Guide

Then help me [describe your task].
```

**However, this approach:**
- Consumes more context in your main conversation
- Requires specifying the path each time
- Doesn't benefit from the coordinator/worker architecture

The custom command setup is recommended for regular WoW addon development.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Command Not Appearing

If `/wow` doesn't appear in the command list:

1. Verify the file exists at: `~/.claude/commands/wow.md`
2. Restart Claude Code
3. Check that the file has proper markdown formatting

### Agent Not Working

If the agent doesn't seem to work properly:

1. Verify the agent file exists at: `~/.claude/agents/WoWAddon-Expert.md`
2. Check that the Local Paths section has valid paths
3. Ensure the GUIDE_DIR path points to this guide directory

### Documentation Not Found

If the agent reports it can't find documentation:

1. Verify GUIDE_DIR in the agent file points to the correct location
2. Check that all documentation files exist in that directory
3. Make sure paths don't have trailing spaces
